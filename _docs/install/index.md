There are several ways for you to install Penrose, and your preference might
depend on your operating system, or intended purpose.

 - [Docker]({{ site.baseurl }}/install/docker/): is a good solution for a reproducible install. You can run or develop Penrose without needing the dependencies on your system.
 - [Local]({{ site.baseurl }}/install/local/): is local installation of Penrose. You will need dependencies on your host.

Since the documentation is under development, for now we recommend using the Docker container (the first link above.)
