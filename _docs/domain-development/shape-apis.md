# General overview

See `ShapeDef` for all the shapes' definitions.

Some things to document for each shape:
* concrete example of making the particular shape in Style, and what it looks like when rendered
* the meaning of each property
* important settings for each shape (e.g. setting an arc to a right angle) and which ones might override other ones
* its base properties or multiple sets of base properties
* its derived properties, and the relationship between its base/derived properties
* how to optimize float parameters of a shape
* how to sample its properties
* any degenerate/edge cases not handled by the shape renderer

# Shapes
