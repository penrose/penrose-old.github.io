To speak the Penrose tongue, you have to know some of the most commonly used terms. Here is a list of them:

# Theory
* __Penrose__
* __Substance__
* __Style__
* __Book__
* __DSLL__

# System
* __Graphical Primitive Instance (GPI)__: a collection of graphical primitives are built into the Style module of the system (e.g.: `Circle`, `Arrow`), which can be used in Style programs. Each instance of such a primitive is called a GPI.
* __Fields__: Substance objects can have fields. TODO: example
* __Property__: Each GPI has a set of properties associated with them. For instance, `Circle` has `r`, `x`, `y` and so on.
* __Style Specification "Sty Spec"__: A collection of Style shapes, their properties, and some extra information of the Substance object they are mapped to.
* __Style Dictionary__: The output of parsing and analyzing both Substance and Style programs is a dictionary structure, mapping from Substance IDs to "Sty Specs". 
* __Translation__
* __Compile-time__: During the compilation process of Substance and/or Style.
* __Computation__
* __Optimization__
* __Objective__
* __Snap Front-end__
* Renderer
