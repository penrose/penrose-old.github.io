Whether you are using Penrose to generate images, or developing a new style,
you won't get very far without installing it! Let's walk through how to do that. 
First, clone the Github repository to your present working directory. If you
are a developer, you might want to fork it first, and then clone your fork.

```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/penrose/penrose.git
cd penrose
```
